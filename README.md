# Entity Framework Live Project Code Summary



# Introduction:
For my final two weeks at The Tech Academy I completed a two week Live Project sprint, collaborating with fellow software developers
using the Agile project management with Azure DevOps and SCRUM processes. This included sprint planning, daily standups and weekly code retrospectives.
The purpose of this project was to build a web application for a local theater and acting company to manage its website content without needing any
technical knowledge. This project was built with the ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework using C#. I was assigned the task of designing the Contact Page for the 
main website and building the  model for the Rental Photo aspects of the web application. I was responsible for the model scaffolding, and CRUD functionality. I also 
developed the Rental Photo storage and retrieval from the database.

## Designing the Contact Page:
For this story I was assigned the task of designing the Contact page for the Theater Vertigo web application. 
I utilized Bootstrap and CSS to create the content and styling of the Contact page. I created a contact form for the 
user to input their contact information. Along with the Contact form I created buttons for the user to be click on and
they are directed to the Donate and Volunteerpages of the web application.

## Rental Photo Area:
For this area of the web application I was tasked with several stories that included utilizing entity framework for the model scaffolding
and CRUD functionality and styling. I also developed a way for Rental Photos to be added to the database as a byte array and then retrieve
the Rental Photo as an image to be displayed on the web pages associated with the Rental Photo area. This includes all of the images that are located 
in the database to be displayed within cards I created using Bootstrap. I used Bootstrap and CSS to style the Create and Edit pages of the web appliction. I created buttons using for the user to be directed to the details sections for that Rental Photo. I also utilized Font Awesome to create buttons for the Edit, Delete and Back to the List functions. I 
followed the CSS color scheme defined within the project when designing all of the web pages in the Rental Photo area.
