# Entity Framework Live Project Code Summary



# Introduction:
For my final two weeks at The Tech Academy I completed a two week Live Project sprint, collaborating with fellow software developers
using the Agile work environment with Azure DevOps and SCRUM processes. This included sprint planning, daily standups and weekly code retrospectives.
The purpose of this project was to build a web application for a local theater and acting company to manage its website content without needing any
technical knowledge. This project was built with the ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework using C#. I was assigned the task of designing the Contact Page for the 
main website and building the  model for the Rental Photo aspects of the web application. I was responsible for the model scaffolding, and CRUD functionality. I also 
developed the Rental Photo storage and retrieval from the database.

## Designing the Contact Page:
For this story I was assigned the task of designing the Contact page for the Theater Vertigo web application. 
I utilized Bootstrap and CSS to create the content and styling of the Contact page utilizing a specific color scheme defined within the project. I created 
a contact form for the user to input their contact information. Along with the Contact form I created buttons for the user to be click on and
they are directed to the Donate and Volunteerpages of the web application.

## Rental Photo Area:
For this area of the web application I was tasked with several stories that included utilizing entity framework for the model scaffolding
and CRUD functionality and styling based on the color scheme defined within the project. I also developed a way for Rental Photos to be added to the database as a byte array and then retrieve the Rental Photo as an image to be displayed on the web pages associated with the Rental Photo area. This includes all of the images that are located 
within the database to be displayed within cards that I created using Bootstrap for the Index page. I used Bootstrap and CSS to style the Create and Edit pages of the web application. The create and edit pages allows the user to create their own rental photo and add the image and rental photo information to be stored into the database. The edit page allows the user to edit any aspect of the rental photo information. I designed the details page which displays the image and all of the details related to that rental photo that is stored within the database. I also designed the delete page that allows the user to delete the rental photo from the database. I utilized Font Awesome to create buttons  that link to the Edit, Delete and Back to the List functions.
